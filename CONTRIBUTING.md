This repository uses [`git-flow`](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) in the [`gitflow-avh` edition](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh) to organize development.

Please raise your PRs against the `develop` branch (regardless of `git-flow` usage).

Before raising a PR, please make sure that
* your code is lint-free (`yarn lint`),
* your code compiles (`yarn build`),
* the tests run through (`yarn test`).
Also don't forget to comment your code properly and add code documentation / tests.

Thanks for contributing!
